                The BS Computer Science program includes the study of computing concepts and theories algorithmic foundations and new developments in computing. The program prepares students to design and create algorithmically complex software and develop new and effective alogorithms for solving computing problems.

                <br><br>

                The program also includes the study of the standards and practice in Software Engineering. It also prepares students to acquire skills and disciplines required for designing, writing, and modifying software components, modules, and applications that comprise software solutions.
